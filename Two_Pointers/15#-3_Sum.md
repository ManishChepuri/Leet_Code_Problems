# Problem 15 - 3 Sum

Similar approach as Two Sum II but just need to apply Two Sum II to every element of the input array. Also need to sort input array first.

### Two Sum II Solution
Input array is sorted. Initialize left pointer to left side of array and right pointer to right side. If the adding both numbers results in a number
less than the desired number, then increment the left pointer by one as this will increase the sum. If adding both numbers results in a number greater than
the desired number then decrement the rigth pointer by one, reducing the sum. Keep repeating and you will eventually get an answer as a solution is guaranteed
based on the problem statement.

### First Attempt
```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        for i, a in enumerate(nums):
            if a == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            l = i + 1
            r = len(nums) - 1
            # Two Sum II
            while l < r:
                threeSum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if threeSum > 0:
                    r -= 1
                elif threeSum < 0:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    res.append([a, nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
        return res         
```

### Debugging
* Doesn't pass test case `[0, 0, 0]`.
* Doesn't increment l if the next l is the same as the previous.

### Final Solution
```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        for i, a in enumerate(nums):
            # Since nums is sorted, if a > 0 then its impossible to sum up to zero
            if a > 0:
                break
            if i > 0 and a == nums[i-1]:
                continue

            l = i + 1
            r = len(nums) - 1
            # Two Sum II
            while l < r:
                threeSum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if threeSum > 0:
                    r -= 1
                elif threeSum < 0:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    res.append([a, nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                    while nums[l] == nums[l - 1] and l < r:
                        l += 1
        return res
```
