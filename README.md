# Leet_Code_Problems
This repository contains my thoughts and solutions to the majority of LeetCode problems I've solved/attempted. 

I am using the problems from NeetCode's Blind 75, 150, 250, and All lists. From each Data Structure or Algorithm category I am doing a total of 8 problems. I watch NeetCodes video explanation of the concept behind a medium problem and then implement the code myself, then I will redo the problem that I watched 2 days prior again without watching the video (active recall), and then I will do an easy problem all by myself. This means I do a total of 3 problems every day but only 2 new problems every day. 

I spend a total of 4 days on each Data Structure or Algorithm category NeetCode specifies.

Total Problems Completed: 11
